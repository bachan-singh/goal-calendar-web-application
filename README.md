## Technology Stack

### Frontend
The application’s frontend is powered by **React**, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface. 
- **React Router** is utilized for seamless navigation between pages.
- State management is efficiently handled through **Redux** or the **Context API**.
- API interactions are facilitated by **Axios**, while styling is implemented using **CSS Modules** or **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a polished and responsive design.

### Backend
The backend, built on **Node.js**, uses **Express.js** to handle RESTful API development.
- **MySQL** serves as the database, providing a robust and relational structure for storing user and goal data.
- Security is prioritized with **BCrypt** for password hashing and **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for authentication.
- **Dotenv** is employed for managing environment variables, enhancing configuration security.

### Libraries and Tools
- **FullCalendar**: An advanced library for creating the calendar interface, supporting event rendering and drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Chart.js**: Used for creating progress charts on the dashboard.
- **Postman**: Facilitated API testing and debugging.
- **Git**: Enabled version control and collaborative development.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Maintained code quality and formatting consistency.
